# My Second Git Project
Tanea Shante Culbreath
Tasks

#1.  I altered the NewIndex.html page's paragraphs and gave them ID references.
#2.  I had my final project in mind for this task and created three buttons.  With my project in mind the user will be able to view a design based on their child's gender. This change comes with the color and visibility of header 2 on the index page.  It appears and changes based on the gender selected. 
#3. Still thinking about final project on this one. I don't know if I am answering the question correctly because I don't know what required means.  The first form I used was for number input. 
    1. input type numbers
        -Not needed for final project
    2. input date
        -I need to use this entry to output a due date for my final
    3. checkbox
        -Not needed for final project
    4. email
        - Could be used for final project
    5. File for profile picture
 #4. There were edits made to the numbers input and to the email input.  I need to figure out the borders better to do a more complex grid.  I will try to have that done by Monday.
